| polyB.sage 	| Programmed in 2013, and updated in 2020, by A. Behn . It contains routines to find generating vectors, simplectic representations corresponding to group actions on Riemann surfaces, to work with intermediate coverings and equisymmetric stratifications of Mg. 	|
| poly4.sage 	| Modified in 2021 by A. Rojas (to update Python changes).                                                           	|
